# Crypto-Stego
 
            Securing data encryption and decryption using cryptography and steganography
      techniques.Due to recent developments in stego analysis, providing security to personal
      contents,messages, or digital images using steganography has become difficult. 

             By using stego analysis, one can easily reveal existence of hidden information in 
      carrier files. This project introduces a novel steganographic approach for communication
      between two private parties. The approach introduced in this project makes use of both
      steganographic as well as cryptographic techniques. In Cryptography we are using RSA.
      In Steganography we are using Image Steganography for hiding the data. And we also 
      use Mutual Authentication process to satisfy all services in Cryptography i.e., Access
      Control,Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication. 

             In this way we can maintain the data  more securely. Since we use RSA algorithm 
      for securing the data and again on this we perform Steganography to hide the data in 
      an image. Such that any other person in the  network cannot access the data present in 
      the network. Only the sender and receiver can retrieve the message from the data.
